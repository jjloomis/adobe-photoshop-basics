# Rasterizing a layer

If you rasterize a layer that contains vector-based objects \(like shapes or text\), you can work with the layer as if it contains an image. For example, you can use the Eraser tool to delete areas of rasterized text.

Note: If you rasterize a text layer, you lose the ability to edit the text.

1. Make sure the layer you want to edit is selected in the Layers panel.
2. Control-click the layer. In the fly-out menu choose Rasterize Layer.
