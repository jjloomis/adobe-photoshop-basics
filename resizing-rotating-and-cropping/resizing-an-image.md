# Resizing an image

1. If necessary, select the layer of the image you'd like to resize.
2. In the Tool bar, select the Move tool. 
3. In the Options bar \(top\), make sure Show Transform Controls is selected. 
4. While holding the Shift key on your keyboard, click and drag one of the corner resizing handles on the image. \(You can hold Shift + Option to maintain the center point of the image while resizing.\)
5. To execute the resizing, press Return \(or Enter\) on the keyboard. \(Photoshop will prevent you from doing most actions until you've done this.\)
