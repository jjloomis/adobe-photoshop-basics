# Changing layer visibility 

1. Make sure the layer you want to edit is selected in the Layers panel.
2. Click the Visibity icon (eye) for layer in the Layers panel to toggle visibility on or off.

Note: If visibily is off, the layer will not be included when the project is saved in a format other than PSD.
