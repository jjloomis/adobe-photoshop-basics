# Rasterizing a layer

Rasterizing converts vector-based items to pixels. If you rasterize a layer that contains text or shapes, you will be be able to work with the layer as if it contains an image. 

Note: If you rasterize a text layer, you lose the ability to edit the text.

1. Make sure the layer you want to edit is selected in the Layers panel.
2. Control-click the layer. In the fly-out menu choose Rasterize Layer.
