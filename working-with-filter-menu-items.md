## Working with Filter menu items

1. Make sure the layer you want to edit is selected in the Layers panel.
2. Go to Filter on the menu bar and choose one of the Filters in the lower half of the menu.
3. Each Filter will have its own Filter control box. Adjust the filter controls as you see fit. (Note: Some Filters, such as Render Flame, will require you to create a Path before the Filter can be applied to the image.)
4. When finished, click OK.
